Dear \studentname's Parent/Guardian,
\vspace{1em}

Thank you for your continued support. I would like to share the community norms guiding our classroom for \textbf{\classtitle} this year and invite you into an active partnership in maintaining a safe, respectful, and productive learning environment. Student success grows when teachers, students, and families work together with the same expectations and goals in mind.

Together, our class has established the following norms to support focus, respect, and positive participation:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{One Mic Period} --- During designated \emph{One Mic periods}, one person speaks at a time.
\item \textbf{Engage in the class activity} --- No side conversations, no unrelated tasks, and no head down during learning time.
\item \textbf{Respect everyone} --- No side comments, no put-downs, and no disrespect toward teachers or peers.
\item \textbf{No touching} --- Respect personal space and boundaries.
\item \textbf{Use appropriate voice levels} and keep the volume low during work time.
\item \textbf{Help maintain a safe and supportive classroom environment} for all.
\end{enumerate}

To encourage accountability and personal growth, each student will receive a \textbf{monthly behavior and community participation report}. Students will also complete a written reflection responding to:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Self-evaluate your classroom behavior this month.
\item Self-evaluate your contribution to the class community this month.
\item Set a goal for your classroom behavior and community contribution next month.
\end{enumerate}

These activities help students develop responsibility, self-awareness, and ownership of their learning environment. Your involvement—reviewing the report, talking with your child about their progress, and reinforcing shared expectations—plays a vital role in strengthening our classroom community.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me at any time. I look forward to working together to ensure your child's success.
