The function $P(t)=256{,}485(0.965)^t$ models the decreasing population
of a city from 1999 to 2014, where $t$ is the time in years since 1999.

Which statement is \textbf{not} true?

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The function estimated the population was 256,485 in 1999.
    \item The decay rate was 0.35\%.
    \item The decay factor is 0.965.
    \item The population declined over 15 years.
\end{enumerate}
