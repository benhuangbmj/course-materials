\vspace{1em}

Dear \studentname's Parent/Guardian,

I hope you are doing well. I am writing to introduce \textbf{Math Rebuilt}, a supplemental math practice program that I have created to support students in strengthening their math skills through consistent daily practice. This is a teacher-created, optional program and is not school-sponsored.

Math is a connected subject, and steady daily practice helps students build understanding and confidence over time. The core expectation of Math Rebuilt is \textbf{30 additional minutes of math practice each day}.

\textbf{What students will do:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use \textbf{DeltaMath}, a free online platform that offers targeted practice with immediate feedback:
    \begin{center}
        \texttt{https://www.deltamath.com/students} \\
        Class code: \deltamathcode
    \end{center}
    \item Watch short math tutorial videos that I will handpick and post in the Algebra II Google Classroom to support review and understanding
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How parents can help and monitor progress:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Encourage a consistent daily practice routine
    \item Ask your child to show you their DeltaMath assignment list and completion status, which clearly displays completed work and progress over time
    \item Provide encouragement and support at home
\end{itemize}

The goal of Math Rebuilt is to help students rebuild strong mathematical foundations and develop productive study habits that support long-term success in mathematics.

Thank you for your continued partnership. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
