## Why the Quadratic Formula Is a Must-Do for the Regents Algebra 1 Exam

As you prepare for the Regents Algebra 1 exam, I want to highlight one topic you _cannot_ afford to skip: **the quadratic formula**.

Here's why it matters so much:

1. **It shows up a lot.**  
   About **5-12% of the exam** involves the quadratic formula, either **directly** (solve a quadratic equation or equation system) or **indirectly** (word problems, graphs, or factoring a polynomial).

2. **It's mechanical and procedural.**  
   This is not about creativity or "math talent." It's about following clear steps. With enough practice, **everyone can do it correctly and consistently**.

3. **The formula is given to you.**  
   You do _not_ need to memorize it. The quadratic formula is printed on the **reference sheet at the back of the exam**. Your job is simply to **decode the formula** and **apply it carefully** to the problem in front of you.

Because of these reasons, the quadratic formula is one of those topics where preparation pays off immediately. It's reliable, predictable, and accessible - and that makes it a **must-do problem** on the Regents.

Practice it enough, and this becomes one of the easiest points you can secure on the exam.
