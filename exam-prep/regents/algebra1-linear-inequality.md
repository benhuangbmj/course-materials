## Why Linear Inequalities and Systems of Inequalities Matter on the Regents Algebra 1 Exam

Linear inequalities and systems of inequalities are an important part of the Regents Algebra 1 exam. They build directly on linear equations and require the same algebraic skills, with extra attention to inequality symbols and graphing solution regions. These problems are procedural and predictable: solve, graph, and interpret the solution set. Because they often appear as modeling or graph-based questions, being comfortable with inequalities helps secure points that are very achievable with practice.
